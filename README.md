# Setup
In order for this to work, you need to install both maven and JDK on your slave.
Log into the slave, and type the following:
```
sudo apt install maven openjdk-8-jdk 
```

# Coding Assignment
While trying to know Jenkins, this will be your coding assignment. It is made just to give you some tangible code to work with:

Given a positive integer number (eg 42) determine
its Roman numeral representation as a String (eg "XLII").

You cannot write numerals like IM for 999.
Wikipedia states "Modern Roman numerals are written by
expressing each digit separately starting with the
leftmost digit and skipping any digit with a value of zero."

Examples:
```
1 ->    "I" | 10 ->    "X" | 100 ->    "C" | 1000 ->    "M"
2 ->   "II" | 20 ->   "XX" | 200 ->   "CC" | 2000 ->   "MM"
3 ->  "III" | 30 ->  "XXX" | 300 ->  "CCC" | 3000 ->  "MMM"
4 ->   "IV" | 40 ->   "XL" | 400 ->   "CD" | 4000 -> "MMMM"
5 ->    "V" | 50 ->    "L" | 500 ->    "D" |
6 ->   "VI" | 60 ->   "LX" | 600 ->   "DC" |
7 ->  "VII" | 70 ->  "LXX" | 700 ->  "DCC" |
8 -> "VIII" | 80 -> "LXXX" | 800 -> "DCCC" |
9 ->   "IX" | 90 ->   "XC" | 900 ->   "CM" |

1990 -> "MCMXC"  (1000 -> "M"  + 900 -> "CM" + 90 -> "XC")
2008 -> "MMVIII" (2000 -> "MM" + 8 -> "VIII")
  99 -> "XCIX"   (90 -> "XC" + 9 -> "IX")
  47 -> "XLVII"  (40 -> "XL" + 7 -> "VII")

```

# Exercises:
### 1. Create a job:
* Go into your Jenkins server at click on the `New Item` button on the left.
* Name your new job "roman numerals" and choose `Freestyle project` and click OK
* Under `Source Code Management` choose git, and paste in your git clone URL for this project (Remember to choose your fork of the project!).
* Choose the credentials that you have set up in Jenkins to auth it against GitHub 
* Click `save` and then the `Build Now` button.
